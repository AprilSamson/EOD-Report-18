# EOD-Report-18
End of the day report:

Date: Tuesday, July 18, 2023

Today was a productive day for me. I took the Jira Service Management fundamentals course, which was informative and engaging. Although I was not able to get the badge yet, I learned a lot. Here are some terms used in JSM:

 ## Issue
An issue is an individual unit of work, such as a customer request or a task created by another agent. 
 ## Request
A request is how an issue is represented to a customer. 
 ## Service project
A service project is a collection of issues and requests to help your team organize and manage work. 
 ##  Help Center
A Help Center is an online website for customers to browse service projects, submit requests, and read articles.
 ##  Queue
A queue is a filtered list of issues based on specific criteria.
 ## Portal
A portal is a place for customers to submit specific requests, search for targeted knowledge, and communicate with agents.
 ##  Request type

## In addition, I helped Fajar find the right course and she was able to get the badge, which was a great accomplishment. I'm glad I was able to assist her.

Finally, I started filling out the DS-160, which is an important task. I'm happy I was able to get started on it.

Overall, it was a successful day.
